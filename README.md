# Spark-java

Spark framework is a rapid development web framework inspired by the Sinatra framework for Ruby and is built around Java 8 Lambda Expression philosophy, making it less verbose than most applications written in other Java frameworks.

It's a good choice if you want to have a Node.js like experience when developing a web API or microservices in Java. With Spark, you can have a REST API ready to serve JSON in less than ten lines of code.
